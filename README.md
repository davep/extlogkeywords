# extlogkeywords

`extlogkeywords` is a simple command line tool that extracts search keywords
from web log files and produces different types of reports based on what it
finds. It doesn't aim to be any better than the other tools that can be
downloaded out on the web, it just happens that I fancied hacking up
something of my own for fun.

The most interesting/pointless feature is its ability to [produce data that
can be fed to
GraphViz](http://davep-mumbling.blogspot.com/2008/04/ruby-graphviz-and-weblogs.html).
